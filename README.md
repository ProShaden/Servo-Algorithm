# Servo-Algorithm
This repository describes an algorithm to run servo motors.

# Algorithm 

1- Open tinkercad and click on create a circuit.

2- Drag arudino uno, servo motors, breadboard into the workspace.

3- Connect servo's ground cable to the negative at the breadboard.

4- Connect the servo's power cable to 5v at the arduino uno.

5- Connect the servo's signal cable to ~9 pin at the arduino uno.

6- Click on code button at the right top and program your circuit.

7- Click on simulate to see your servo works.
